              My passion for applying Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence
              to real-world challenges has grown stronger as I've developed my
              skills over the years. The deeper I delve into this field, the
              more I admire its potential to elegantly address complex issues in
              areas like cybersecurity, air/marine defense systems, and computer
              vision for medical imaging.

              I completed my MS in Computer Science from Prairie View A&M
              University, Texas, USA. My masterâ€™s thesis focused on applying
              machine learning to sports, where I developed predictive models
              for player performance and game outcomes. This work involved
              leveraging statistical and computational techniques to optimize
              teaming strategies in sports management.

              Beyond my research pursuits, I have a deep passion for traveling
              and immersing myself in nature. I find great joy in exploring new
              places and experiencing different cultures. Additionally, I enjoy
              swimming, playing badminton, and engaging in chess.
